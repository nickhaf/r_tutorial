title: "Data sets"

We will use two data sets during this workshop. One for the theory, and one for you to work on in the exercises.

## Theory: Olympic athletes

For the theory part of the workshop, we will mainly work with the `athletes` data set, downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results). It contains the Olympic athletes from 1896 to 2016, along with some basic stats, their sport and country, and the medals they won. Our goal for the theory part of this workshop is to plot the number of medals by country in each sport, and learn R along the way!

## Exercises: Fictional characters

Over the course of this workshop, you can work on exercises to train the theoretical knowledge acquired in the chapters. Most of these exercises will use the `characters` data set, downloaded from [here](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/documentation/), which contains psychometric ratings for different fictional characters, rated by a large number of people on a personality scale developed by the author of the questionnaire.

You will load the data, prepare it for analyses and also plot it in the end.
