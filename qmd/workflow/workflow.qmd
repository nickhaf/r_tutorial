## Workflow

### RStudio Projects

Over time, it will become increasingly hard to organize all your files, working directories and workspaces in a reasonable manner. A reasonable big project will consists of multiple script files, data, output and plots. To keep everything together, RStudio Projects can be used (highly recommended). Therefore, when starting a new project in R, the first thing you should do is creating an RStudio project.

You can create a new RStudio project by clicking on `File - New Project` in the RStudio window.

### Scripts

Scripts are the documents code is saved in.

When only coding in our [console](#console) we quickly run into the question where to save our code for further evaluation. Therefore, we want to write all our important code into a [script](https://nickhaf.github.io/r_tutorial/qmd/setup/setup.html#script-pane).

Therefore, every time you start a new project, you should also create at least one script to put your code in. You can also split up long code among several scripts to make it more readable.

You can create a new script by clicking on `File - New File - R Script` in the RStudio window.

Now it's your turn! In the [Workflow exercise](https://nickhaf.github.io/r_tutorial/qmd/workflow/workflow_exercise.html) you will set yourself up for the following workshop.
