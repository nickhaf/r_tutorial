# Packages

Packages are extensions to the `base R` you get by default. We can compare them somewhat to apps in an appstore:

But you can also download packages form other sources, for example [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is what you did when downloading the `tutoR` package in [About this workshop](setup.qmd#about-this-workshop).

[^packages-1]: Icons from [icons8.de](https://icons8.de).

-   Note that in `install.packages("packagename")` we have to put the package into quotation marks, when calling `library(packagename)` not.
